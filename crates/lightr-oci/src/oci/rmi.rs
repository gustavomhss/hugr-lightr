//! `oci rmi <ref>...` — remove image ref(s), Docker-faithful (WP-IMG-07).
//!
//! Removing an image ref **untags** it: the named store ref and its image
//! sidecars (config + manifest record) are deleted, so the image vanishes from
//! `oci images`. The underlying CAS objects are NOT deleted here — they become
//! gc candidates, reclaimed by `lightr gc` (rmi never sweeps the CAS).
//!
//! Guards (Docker parity):
//!   • **in-use** — a ref booted by a running container (its `rootfs_ref`) is
//!     refused without `-f` ("image is being used"); `-f` force-removes it.
//!   • **absent** — an unknown ref is an error ("No such image").
//!
//! The in-use set is INJECTED (the set of `rootfs_ref`s of running instances),
//! computed by the CLI from `lightr_run::ps` — so this logic stays free of a
//! lightr-run dependency and is parallel-testable against a tempdir store.
