//! Networking Phase 1 — userspace TCP port forwarder for published runs.
//!
//! This is the daemonless forward-proxy model: exactly how rootless docker /
//! podman publish ports (slirp/pasta are userspace). A detached, supervised run
//! that publishes `-p HOST:CONTAINER` gets, for each mapping, a forwarder that
//! binds `127.0.0.1:HOST`, accepts connections, and for EACH accepted
//! connection dials `127.0.0.1:CONTAINER` (where the run's server listens) and
//! pumps bytes both ways.
//!
//! It generalizes compose's proven `proxy_bidirectional` (lightr-build) and
//! IMPROVES on it: the accept-loop serves multiple connections — sequential AND
//! concurrent — by spawning a thread per accepted connection. Compose is left
//! untouched in Phase 1.
//!
//! Lifetime: `start` returns a [`Forwarder`] the caller owns. Dropping it (or
//! the supervisor exiting) closes the listener; the accept loop then ends. TCP
//! only in v1.
