//! Run-instance lifecycle PRIMITIVES (SKELETON-FREEZE) — the daemonless
//! building blocks the container-verb WPs (LIFE-02..20: rm / kill / start /
//! restart / wait / stop) call so each verb's CLI handler reuses one
//! implementation instead of re-deriving run-dir / registry logic and colliding
//! on the shared files.
//!
//! These are PRIMITIVES, not verbs: they carry NO CLI output, NO Docker-faithful
//! flag parsing, NO multi-arg fan-out. The verb behaviour (output format,
//! exit-code mapping, `force`/`time` flag grammar) is the LIFE-02..20 WPs' job;
//! here we only expose pure-ish functions over a single resolved run id.
//!
//! House conventions honoured:
//!   * the `home` root is INJECTED by the caller (like `registry` / `ps`), never
//!     read from the global env here — so the unit tests pass a private tempdir
//!     and run safely in parallel (CI is `cargo test --workspace`, multi-thread).
//!   * resolution (`registry::resolve`) happens at the CALL SITE; these take an
//!     already-resolved id, so a verb resolves once and reuses the id.
//!   * every existing helper is REUSED (registry / ps-logic / stop / ctl /
//!     spawn) — nothing is reinvented.
//!
//! Fail-closed throughout: an unknown / malformed run surfaces an honest error,
//! a RUNNING run is refused for destructive ops unless `force`.
